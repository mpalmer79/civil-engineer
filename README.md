# Civil Engineer AI: Stormwater Review Assistant

Civil Engineer AI is a portfolio GenAI system that assists stormwater and
site-plan review using document evidence, checklist validation, risk flagging,
human review, audit logging, and evaluation tracking.

It is a **review-support and evidence-organization** system for land development
workflows. It is **not** a licensed engineering tool and does not replace
professional engineering judgment.

> **Professional boundary.** Civil Engineer AI assists review. It does not
> approve plans, certify compliance, stamp or seal drawings, replace a licensed
> Professional Engineer, or make final safety determinations. Every finding is a
> review-support issue that needs reviewer confirmation.

## Current phase: Phase 3, Document Evidence and Retrieval Foundation

Phase 3 adds the foundation for source evidence and retrieval so every
review-support finding can trace back to specific pages and sections of the
submitted documents. It adds:

- A **document chunk** data model and 56 seeded synthetic chunks
- **Finding sources** that link the ten findings to chunks with an evidence role
  and confidence
- A keyword and metadata **retrieval service**
- **API endpoints** for chunks, search, checklist evidence, finding evidence, and
  finding sources
- **Frontend evidence display** on the findings, checklist, and documents pages,
  and an evidence-first section on the homepage
- **Backend tests** proving retrieval works on the seeded fixture

Retrieval is keyword and metadata based in this phase. Phase 3 does not add live
AI-generated findings, embeddings, a vector store, or authentication. Those are
planned for later phases.

Earlier phases established the product foundation:

- Phase 0: research, domain model, and the Brookside Meadows project story
- Phase 1: a static Next.js prototype driven by seed data
- Phase 2: a FastAPI backend, SQLite database, SQLAlchemy models, seeded data,
  API endpoints, tests, and frontend integration

The reviewed fixture remains **Brookside Meadows**: a 47-lot single-family
subdivision in the Town of Hartwell with a green-and-gray stormwater treatment
train and ten intentionally planted review issues.

## Getting started

### Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```

Set the backend URL for the frontend with an environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

When the backend is reachable, pages render live data from it. When it is not,
they fall back to the local seed data so the app still works.

### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.db.seed            # load the Brookside Meadows fixture
uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # http://localhost:8000
pytest
```

See [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) for full backend setup and route
examples.

## Frontend routes

| Route | Page | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Home | Hero map, metrics, how it works, professional boundary, future modules |
| `/project` | Project dashboard | Brookside Meadows summary, site conditions, improvements, constraints |
| `/documents` | Document library | The seeded submission package with status and planted issues |
| `/checklist` | Stormwater checklist | 19 structured review items with expected statuses |
| `/findings` | Findings | The 10 expected review-support findings |
| `/audit` | Audit trail | Seeded, traceable review history |
| `/evaluation` | Evaluation dashboard | 8 evaluation cases with recall and citation metrics |

## Backend endpoints

All data routes use the `/api/v1` prefix. Seeded project id:
`proj_brookside_meadows`.

## What Phase 3 proves

- Review is evidence-first: every finding traces back to specific document
  chunks with page and section references.
- Retrieval is transparent and testable: keyword and metadata ranking with a
  plain relevance reason for each result.
- The professional boundary holds in retrieval output: every result is framed as
  source evidence for reviewer evaluation, not a conclusion, and no prohibited
  final-decision language is used.

## What comes next

- **Phase 4**: the AI review assistant (structured prompts, JSON validation,
  safety checks, findings that cite retrieved evidence, human review required for
  every finding).
- **Phase 5**: the live evaluation harness.

See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full plan.
