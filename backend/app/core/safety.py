"""Central safety and status vocabulary for Civil Engineer AI.

Civil Engineer AI is a review-support and evidence-organization system. It must
never present itself as a licensed engineering tool. This module is the single
source of truth for the status values the system may use and for the
final-decision language it must never apply to a status or finding conclusion.

Explanatory prose elsewhere may state that the system does not approve plans.
That is different from applying a prohibited word as a status or conclusion,
which this module exists to prevent.
